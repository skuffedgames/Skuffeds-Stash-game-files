Unfortunately, the site, rentry.org/skuffedstash, may soon be blocked and moved. I do apologize for that but you can blame it on the underclassmen of our school. (6,7,8th grade ect).
they were given the stash through a chain of shares and are now openly, in front of teachers, showing and using the website haphazardly. Its unfortunate, but I do have a solution.

Once Skuffed's Stash is blocked on rentry, i will move it to another pastebin website, then redistribute. I do again apologize for this inconveniece.
